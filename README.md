The Report of code reading project is available [here.](https://github.com/Omid-SH/Mobile_CodeReading_Android/blob/master/Android_CodeReading_Project_Report.pdf)

We will write small review here.

# Main Project
## LiveEdgeDetection

LiveEdgeDetection is an Android document detection library built on top of OpenCV. It scans documents from camera live mode and allows you to adjust crop using the detected 4 edges and performs perspective transformation of the cropped image.

**It works best with a dark background.**

# What we did

Based on this project, we have developed an scanner app!
In this app you can scan multiple pictures, save each of them in your galley and make a PDF fill using these picture. There is also a feature like a galley mode view that you can move through scanned pictures and delete whatever you want.
